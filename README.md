Encryption Algorithm Comparison
This repository contains a Java application that simulates and compares the performance of two widely used encryption algorithms: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA). The application includes key generation, small text encryption and decryption, and error handling simulations.

Overview
Key Features
AES Encryption and Decryption

Simulates the encryption and decryption of small text messages using AES.
Measures key generation time for AES.
RSA Encryption and Decryption

Simulates the encryption and decryption of small text messages using RSA.
Measures key generation time for RSA.
Error Handling Simulation

Intentionally introduces errors during encryption and decryption to assess how well AES and RSA handle these scenarios.
Key Generation Time
The application measures and compares the time required for key generation in both AES and RSA. This metric provides insights into the efficiency of generating cryptographic keys for secure communication.

Small Text Encryption and Decryption
The application evaluates the performance of AES and RSA in encrypting and decrypting small text messages. This analysis sheds light on the speed and efficiency of each algorithm when handling common use cases involving short pieces of data.

Error Handling
Simulated error scenarios assess how robustly AES and RSA handle errors during encryption and decryption processes. This analysis is crucial for understanding the algorithms' behavior in imperfect conditions and enhancing the reliability of applications.
